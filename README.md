# Project Overview

Tesitng with [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) 

Front End Nanodegree Udacity - FeedReader Project

In this project, we were given a premade RSS-Feed web app and were required to implement some testing for it. The goal of this project was to become familiar with Jasmine, and successfully write a test suite for the given app.


## Steps required to successfully run the application

Download the zip file or git clone repo to your Desktop.
Open index.html in your browser.

## Testing the application
To test the application:
 - Click on the 'hamburger' menu icon to invoke the slide-in sidebar menu where you will see available feeds.
 - Select the feed you are interested in.
 - To hide the menu sidebar, click on the 'hamburger' icon again. Otherwise, when a new feed is selected, it will be hidden automatically.
- The feed entries under each feed are active links, and clicking on them will redirect you to the new page.
- All the Jasmine App Tests you can see below the RSS feed item list.
